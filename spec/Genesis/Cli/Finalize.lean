  genesis_finalize CLI

  NOTE: Token reward finalization is future work. The reward parameters
  (emission, caps, contributor/reviewer splits) have not been defined yet.
  This tool currently computes only weights from the indices.

  Input:  {"indices": [...]}
  Output: {"note": "...", "weights": [...]}
