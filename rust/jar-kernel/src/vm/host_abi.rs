//! Host-call ABI: protocol slot numbers and register conventions.
//!
//! javm's `KernelResult::ProtocolCall { slot }` carries the protocol slot
//! number (1..=28). We assign one slot per kernel host call. Args + return
//! values flow through registers φ[7..12] and through guest memory windows
//! addressed by pointer arguments.
//!
//! Register conventions:
//! - φ[7]..φ[12] carry up to 6 inputs.
//! - φ[7] carries the primary return value; φ[8] the secondary (when used).
//! - Pointer/length pairs reference the guest's flat memory window.

/// Reserved gaps:
/// - Slot 1 / 2 / 3 — formerly `Gas` / `SelfId` / `Caller`, retired in
///   favour of `Capability::Gas` / `SelfId` / `CallerVault` / `CallerKernel`
///   placed at ephemeral sub-slots 3 / 2 / 1 by the kernel at invocation
///   entry. Guests read them via cap-ref into the ephemeral table.
/// - Slot 7 / 8 / 9 — formerly `CnodeGrant` / `CnodeRevoke` / `CnodeMove`,
///   retired in favour of javm management ecallis (`MGMT_DROP`, dynamic-ecall
///   `MOVE` / `COPY`) operating through cap-indirection on the unified
///   cap-table.
/// - Slot 10 — formerly `CapDerive`, retired (replacement direction: javm
///   `MGMT_DOWNGRADE`).
/// - Slot 11 — formerly `CapCall`, retired in favour of plain javm CALL on
///   a Handle / Callable cap-table slot.
/// - Slot 12 / 13 / 14 — formerly `VaultInitialize` / `CreateVault` /
///   `QuotaSet`, retired (these are kernel-internal operations triggered by
///   `Command::*` post-execution, not guest-visible host calls).
/// - Slot 17 — formerly `AttestationAggregate`, retired (was a no-op stub
///   returning success; BLS aggregation isn't wired yet).
/// - Slot 20 — formerly `SlotEmit`, retired (step-3 emit is unimplemented).
