//! σ snapshot for per-event Transact rollback.

//! `State` uses `Arc<Vault>` for vault contents; cloning σ clones the outer
//! BTreeMaps + bumps Arc refcounts (cheap). On a Transact-event fault, the
//! kernel restores from the snapshot — modified vaults are dropped because
//! `Arc::make_mut` had cloned the inner `Vault` on first write.
