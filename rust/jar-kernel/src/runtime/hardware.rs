//! Hardware abstraction.
//!
//! Each `Kernel<H>` owns one `H`. The runtime creates a fresh `Hardware`
//! per node — there is no `Arc<H>` blanket; cross-task sharing is done by
//! wrapping the `Kernel` in `Arc`, not the inner hardware.
//!
//! Hardware exposes only the operations that need external resources:
//!
//! - **state custody**: `genesis_state`, `state_at`, `commit_state`. The
//!   kernel uses these to load the starting state at construction and to
//!   persist post-block state. The internals (in-memory map vs on-disk
//!   db) are hardware-private.
//! - **secret-key custody**: `sign`, `holds_key`.
//! - **network outbox**: `emit`, `subscribe`.
//! - **fork-tree management**: `score`, `finalize`, `head`.
//! - **tracing**: `tracing_event` (no semantic effect; observability only).
//!
//! Crypto (hash, verify, block_hash) is kernel-static — see
//! `jar_kernel::crypto`.
